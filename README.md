# SeaSharpShell
This is a simple shell written in C# that can run commands and display the output. It is a simple project that I made to learn more about C# and how to interact with the command line. It is not meant to be a full shell, but rather a simple project to learn from.
The main shell I'm making is in C++ and is called SeaShell and this is a simple version of that.

# How to use
I'm using the Rider IDE to develop this project, but you can use Visual Studio or any other C# IDE to run this project, using C# 12 and .NET 8.0.

## Global Usings
These are the global usings that I'm using in this project, which are automatically added by Rider.
```csharp
global using global::System;
global using global::System.Collections.Generic;
global using global::System.IO;
global using global::System.Linq;
global using global::System.Net.Http;
global using global::System.Threading;
global using global::System.Threading.Tasks;
